# Snake, Water, Gun Game ðŸŽ®

This is my first Python project â€” a command-line game based on the classic Snake, Water, Gun logic. The player competes against the computer in a single round. Iâ€™ve used `if-else` and `nested-if` conditional expressions, along with the `random` module to simulate computer choices.

## How to Play
- Enter `'s'` for Snake, `'w'` for Water, or `'g'` for Gun.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- The winner is decided based on the following rules:
  - Snake drinks Water â†’ Snake wins
  - Water douses Gun â†’ Water wins
  - Gun kills Snake â†’ Gun wins

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- `random` module
